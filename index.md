## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.jpg">

Hi! My name is Pradip Krishnaa Murugan. I was born in India, raised in UAE, and educated in USA and Germany. I love experiencing new cultures and traveling so much that learning languages is one of my biggest passions.  
I am fluent in English, Tamil, and Kannada with moderate-to-begineer knowledge in German, French, and Arabic.  

I am a Master's student in **Mechanical Engineering** at Purdue University. I currently do research at the Fluid Dynamics Lab on a renewable energy system as a product development engineer. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and minors in Business Economics and Global Engineering Studies from Purdue. Needless to say, I'm a Boilermaker through and through! 

I have always been passionate about product design and development. I have been fortunate to gain valuable industrial and research experience from Textron, Leibniz University, Audi, and Rane in USA, Germany, UAE, and India. 

**Let's chat!** Please reach out to me via [Email](mailto:pmurugan@purdue.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradipkrishnaa)

## Research Interest

I currently work on mechanical product design and development of a modular river current energy converter to harness power from low velocity river flow in local rivers. I innovate, test, and implement novel designs to meet and surpass industry standards in efficiency, structural integrity, and mechanical performance. My work is mainly performed using Siemens NX, SolidWorks, NX Nastran, and MATLAB.
